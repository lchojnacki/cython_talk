# Cython: Slides and code examples

This repository contains materials from a presentation on Cython. It includes
two main directories:

- `code` – contains sample algorithms used during the presentation.
- `cython_slides` – contains the slides from the presentation.

The requirements and instructions for running each of them can be found inside
the directories.
